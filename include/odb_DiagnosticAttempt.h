// Class       : odb_DiagnosticAttempt
//
// Description : This class represents a single attempt in the incremental
//               iterative solution process. Every attempt is assigned a
//               number that uniquely identifies the attempt within the
//               context of a given increment. The attempt number is an 
//               internal artifice and should not be confused with attempt
//               numbers used by the solver. In the solver, attempt numbers
//               need not be unique within the context of a given increment. 
//               In particular, if an attempt is abandoned to perform an
//               equation reordering but a cutback is not necessary then
//               the solver will reuse the same attempt number (the reasoning
//               behind this is that the attempt number factors into the
//               automatic incrementation scheme and if an attempt is 
//               abandoned to perform a reordering but the attempt size
//               does not need to be cutback then the automatic incrementation
//               scheme should not be affected).
//
//               Attempt objects serve as a container for iteration objects
//               and provide information as to the status of the automatic
//               incrementation scheme (such as the attempt size and the
//               reason(s) why an attempt was abandoned).
